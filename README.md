# everygoth

### What is this?

This is the source code for my Twitter bot, [@everygoth](https://twitter.com/everygoth).

### What's it do?

[@everygoth](https://twitter.com/everygoth) tweets the names of goth people.

Its dark task shall never complete.

### Who made this?

I made this. You can follow me on [@haograms](https://twitter.com/haograms). Send me a shoutout if you'd please :)

everygoth took me [five years](https://twitter.com/objelisks/status/588844148272320513) to make. Why did it take so long? Well, I had to learn how to code and the related skills. And I studied and learned all of that on the side while surviving with skills I already had.

I wrote and deployed v1 one week before starting at the Turing School of Software and Design (Back End Engineering). My bot started evolving with me as I've learned more and more.

With the v4 release, it is now set to tweet indefinitely. That means this program should continue working long after I am dead (and you too, reader!). Fun!

The v1.0 implementation was heavily influenced [Jake Faris](https://twitter.com/fake_jaris)'s bots written in Ruby. I followed his [article](https://farisj.github.io/quick_start_guide_on_making_a_twitter_bot/) and asked him some deployment [questions](https://twitter.com/haograms/status/1252812599734857731).

I would also like to thank [Emily Cain](https://twitter.com/data_bae) for writing a super helpful [article](https://dev.to/emcain/how-to-set-up-a-twitter-bot-with-python-and-heroku-1n39) on deploying to Heroku.
